## Real-Fake Image Classification

> This Repo contains code snippets for classifying an image into either real or fake. 
+ __prepro.py__ preprocess the dataset and form numpy arrays of images and labels
+ __classifier.py__ consist of machine learning model made using keras to classify the images.
+ __Server.py__ consit the code for backend of web app and runs classifier in it for prediction
+ __templates__ consist of HTML files 


_Dataset Used :_ [Real and Fake Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/ciplab/real-and-fake-face-detection)

+ 1st Submission(10 PM) : Complitied till training of Model
+ 2nd Submission(10 AM) : Completed till integration of Model with website
+ 3rd Submission(4 PM) : Full Fledge deployed web app with decent UI (Pending)
